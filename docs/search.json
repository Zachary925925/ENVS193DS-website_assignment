    "text": "Environmental Studies\nWhen I first enrolled, I intended to study environmental engineering, but to my awkward surprise, our school only offered environmental science. However, after spending some time exploring the subject, I quickly discovered my passion — the branch of environmental science that focuses on energy. I had the opportunity to learn about different types of power plants, and I found myself especially drawn to renewable energy stations. I hope that in my future academic journey, I can contribute to decarbonizing energy production, truly working towards ensuring humanity’s sustainable development and long-term survival.”"

We developed estimates of the country’s wind and solar resources using spatial analysis and weather data that, along with the country’s existing generation capacity and expected future demand, formed the inputs to the renewable energy value (REV) model. For three different renewable energy targets (200GW, 400 GW, and 600 GW) and five mixes of wind and solar capacity, the REV model determined the amount of new conventional capacity required to meet demand along with the system costs and carbon emissions. Helped with raw data processing and in the middle of individual research (India’s carbon footprints based on electricity generation using spatial information)"
