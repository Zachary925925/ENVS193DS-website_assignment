    "text": "Hi! I am Zach. I am a 3rd year undergraduate student in UCSB majoring Environmental Studies. I am typically interested in renewable energy field. I am also a member of CETlab in ucsb, currently working with raw data and building models for electricity power grid system. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, landscape photographing, and car racing. I have hiked and camped in Iceland, Holland, US, and China. Feel free to poke around my website to learn more!\nhi hello"

For three different renewable energy targets (200GW, 400 GW, and 600 GW) and five mixes of wind and solar capacity, the REV model determined the amount of new conventional capacity required to meet demand along with the system costs and carbon emissions.
