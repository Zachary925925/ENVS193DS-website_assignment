## Photography

Ever since high school, I've been captivated by photography, and over the past five years, it has become woven into the fabric of my life. Wherever I wander, I carry my camera with me, eager to capture both the fleeting beauty of everyday moments and the breathtaking wonders of the world. Those are some pictures I took.

## Camping&Hiking

Camping and hiking have profoundly shaped my life as well. I cherish those moments when I wander through nature, attuned to the whispers of the wild, inhaling the fresh scents of the earth. Each time I do this, an unspeakable joy wells up within me, filling my heart with a quiet, boundless happiness.
