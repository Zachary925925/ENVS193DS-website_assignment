## Photography

Ever since high school, I've been captivated by photography, and over the past five years, it has become woven into the fabric of my life. Wherever I wander, I carry my camera with me, eager to capture both the fleeting beauty of everyday moments and the breathtaking wonders of the world. Those are some pictures I took.

## Camping&Hiking

Camping and hiking have profoundly shaped my life as well. I cherish those moments when I wander through nature, attuned to the whispers of the wild, inhaling the fresh scents of the earth. Each time I do this, an unspeakable joy wells up within me, filling my heart with a quiet, boundless happiness.

## Environmental Studies

When I first enrolled, I intended to study environmental engineering, but to my awkward surprise, our school only offered environmental science. However, after spending some time exploring the subject, I quickly discovered my passion — the branch of environmental science that focuses on energy. I had the opportunity to learn about different types of power plants, and I found myself especially drawn to renewable energy stations. I hope that in my future academic journey, I can contribute to decarbonizing energy production, truly working towards ensuring humanity’s sustainable development and long-term survival."
